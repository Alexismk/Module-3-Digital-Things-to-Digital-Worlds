Everybody has a different idea of love.

Don’t pay any attention to what they write about you. Just measure it in inches.

Publicity is like eating peanuts. Once you start you can’t stop.

I have Social Disease. I have to go out every night. I love going out every night. It’s so exciting.

Publicity is the ultimate symptom of Social Disease.

I will go to the opening of anything, including a toilet seat.

The artificial fascinates me, the bright and the shiny.

Pop art is for everyone.

I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They’re beautiful. Everybody’s plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic.

Sex is more exciting on the screen and between the pages than between the sheets.

I am a deeply superficial person.

Success is when the checks don’t bounce.


The most exciting thing is not doing it. If you fall in love with someone and never do it, it’s much more exciting.
In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.

An artist is somebody who produces things that people don’t need to have.

They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.

Art is what you can get away with.

It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop.

As soon as you stop wanting something, you get it.

It’s not what you are that counts, it’s what they think you are.

I just do art because I’m ugly and there’s nothing else for me to do.

Sex is the biggest nothing of all time.

The nicer I am, the more people think I’m lying.

I don’t see anything wrong with being alone, it feels great to me.



“Why do people spend their time being sad when they could be happy?”

“I don’t want to be smart, because being smart makes you depressed.”

“I have Social Disease. I have to go out every night. If I stay home one night I start spreading rumours to my dogs.”

“The best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do.”

“I always notice flowers.”

“People should fall in love with their eyes closed.” 

“I'm afraid that if you look at a thing long enough, it loses all of its meaning.” 

“You have to do stuff that average people don't understand because those are the only good things.”
